Remove single-letter words at the end of a line

Sierotki Eliminator tackles a common issue in Polish typography known as "sierotki" (literally "orphans"). In Polish texts, single-letter words like "a", "i", "o", "u", "w", or "z" at the end of a line are considered typographic errors.

This plugin automatically replaces the space after these single-letter words with a non-breaking space, ensuring they always stay with the following word. By eliminating "sierotki", it enhances the visual appeal and readability of your Polish text in Figma designs.

Whether you're a Polish designer or working on Polish-language projects, Sierotki Eliminator helps you maintain proper typography.
